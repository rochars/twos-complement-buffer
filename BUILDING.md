# Building twos-complement-buffer

Building works the same on all platforms:
```
npm run build
```
This will lint the sources, test the sources, compile the distribution files, test the distribution files and generate the documentation.

There **should** be no warnings during the build.

The API documentation is generated in the *docs/* folder.
